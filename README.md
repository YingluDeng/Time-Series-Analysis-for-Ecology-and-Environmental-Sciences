# Time Series Analysis for Ecology and Environmental Sciences

## Introduction: 
Beijing (the Capital of China) faces severe haze pollution problems mainly due to coal-based energy consumption which increases the PM2.5 concentrations. PM2.5 is a 2.5 micrometer or less than 2.5 particle pollutant exposure in the air. Because of the poor air quality, it increases hospital admissions for lung or heart causes, chronic or acute bronchitis. Here we discovered the data of PM2.5 and meteorological variations starting from the year of 2010 to 2015. The PM2.5 time series analysis shows average PM2.5 concentrations in Winter is slightly higher than the other seasons. By using seasonal ARIMA, the PM2.5 concentrations can be predicted for 2015 and the trend is decreasing year by year. Also, the null hypothesis of the environment has no effect on the PM2.5 (like Temperature, wind, snow, rain) is proven as false and MARSS model proves that the environment shows a significant effect on PM2.5. We end with a discussion of the possible results by which the dynamic factors may affect PM2.5 in some way. Predicting the future trend and giving out some plausible suggestions for communities and government to solve for this PM2.5 pollution problem.
